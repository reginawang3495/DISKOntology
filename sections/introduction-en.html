<p> The DISK vocabulary aims to represent a novel approach to automate the hypothesize-test-evaluate discovery cycle by capturing data analytics expertise and applying it to automatically test given hypotheses by analyzing existing data repositories. Our approach captures three types of data analytics knowledge: 1) common data analytic methods that can each be run on different types of data, represented as semantically-enriched computational workflows; 2) meta-analysis methods that aggregate the results of different data analysis methods, represented as meta-workflows; and 3) data analysis strategies that specify for a type of hypothesis what data and methods to use, represented as lines of inquiry. 
</p>
<p>
Given a hypothesis specified by a scientist, appropriate lines of inquiry are triggered, which lead to retrieving relevant datasets, running relevant workflows on that data, and finally running meta-workflows on workflow results.  The final report generated includes a level of confidence on the initial hypothesis (or a revised hypothesis) based on the data and methods applied, and a detailed provenance record of the results.</p>
